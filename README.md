# TheFigmaPlayground
These are all of the essentials you will need to follow along with the instructor. 

# An Introduction to Figma
The purpose of this workshop is to get acquainted with Figma’s interface and capabilities. In essence, we will take a hands-on, practical approach and begin designing a simple mercantile phone app. As the demand for ecommerce grows, there will be clients asking to see the designs of professional Figma users. 
Please note that Figma is a prototyping graphics tool used to help create and share website designs and applications. It does not automatically code everything in for you. For that, you’ll need to learn CSS, Javascript, and HTML, or use WordPress (or Webflow, etc) to create a functioning website/app. 
Moreover, don’t feel compelled to copy everything down as is. If you want to explore Figma on your own and make your own adjustments, find different images to use, use different colours, use the same design for a desktop website, make the prototype accessible to colourblind folk, etc. The possibilities and variations are endless. 
What we will cover:
-	Introducing the concept of Layers, Groups, Variants/Variables, and Components/Assets
-	Creating Frames, Rectangles, Ellipses, Lines, and other Objects
-	Adding Text, Colour, and external Images
-	Adding Icons to the project
-	Adding various effects to objects/components/assets
-	Adding in basic Transition Animations and presenting the Prototype
